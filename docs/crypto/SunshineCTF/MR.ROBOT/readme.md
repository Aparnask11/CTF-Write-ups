### Description
```What I'm about to tell you c3Vue2 is top secret. A conspiracy hlbG bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the xvX3dv guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the cmxk guys that play God without permission. And now I think they're fQ== following me.
```
### Idea
```
Read the given challenge description carefully, bring all base64 strings together in a order and use base64 module for converting base64 to bytes

```
#### Script
```
import base64                   
a = "c3Vue2hlbGxvX3dvcmxkfQ=="  
pt = base64.b64decode(a)        
print(pt)
```

#### flag
``b'sun{hello_world}'``
