## Description 

Try to reveal what is hidden in this jpg.

## Solution:

We are given only a screenshot. But if we look closely we find a `twitter` tab open.
After a bit of googling, we found the twitter account 'Gilberto Georcia'
![](../../assests/1.png)

From his profile we get his date of birth `November 20, 1994.`
On checking Gilberto's profile, we find a tweet
![](../../assests/2.png)

So, this must be Gilberto's brother that we are searching for.`@gerardo_2001_`
Going through his profile, we can guess his birth year from the username i.e `2001`.
On going through his profile, we find a tweet which tells us his bday - `Dec 23, 2001`
![](../../assests/3.3.png)

Also there is a link to his github account. Going through the profile, we can get the company name - `Greg Tech`

Difference between November 20, 1994 and December 23, 2001 is 2590 
Therefore, the flag: gigem{greg_tech_2590}

## Flag
